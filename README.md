## About

This is an algoritm that can solve mastermind games. It uses the approach of Claude Shannon to determine the best guess in each case, the one that maximises
the quantity of information you get back on average (in "Bit" unit). I use Python because it's fun.



I also try to do some stats around my results, average scores, ...

The script is not optimized, but I will at some point work on it.

I'll surely try to animate my result, using manim or some other library.
